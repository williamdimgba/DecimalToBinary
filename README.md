# DecimalToBinary
##This program is designed to convert a decimal number into its binary representation, splitting the number into an integer part and a fractional part, and then converting each part separately using a stack and a queue, respectively.

##This program demonstrates the use of a stack and a queue implemented with linked lists to convert a decimal number into its binary representation. The program separates the integer and fractional parts of the decimal number and converts each part individually, providing a comprehensive solution for binary conversion.
